<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Pavan Pirates, a data wizard by day and a cybersecurity ninja by night. 
I turn raw data into golden insights and protect the digital world from cyber villains. </p>
<p>When I’m not taming dragons (debugging code), I enjoy exploring new tech skills and sipping 
on potions of creativity (coffee). Ready to embark on epic quests and solve digital mysteries!</p>
